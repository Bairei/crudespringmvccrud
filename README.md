### Deployment notes
* Make sure that all maven dependencies are downloaded (you can do it by, for example, executing command `mvn package` in project's main directory)
* Tomcat servlet container is highly recommended for deploying project's .jar file
* You can also simply execute `mvn spring-boot:run` command
* If user doesn't have maven installed, execute maven wrapper (`mvnw`) 
instead
